I am a health policy researcher interested in Patient-Centered Healthcare: 

* What does that mean? 
* How do we know when it exists or not? 
* How can health systems get better at providing it?



My work is mixed-methods, and I am especially interested in repurposing the vast amounts of data that are routinely collected by health services to improve access to, and the quality and efficiency of, healthcare. 

I grew up in the United States, and received my postgraduate training in the UK. My undergraduate degree is in Political Economy from Tulane University. My MSc is in International Health Policy from the London School of Economics and Political Science. My PhD is in Health Services Research from the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London.
