Katelyn Smalley is a mixed-methods health policy researcher with a primary interest in the notion of Patient-Centered Care: 

* What is it? 
* How do we know when it exists or not? 
* How can health systems get better at providing it?

She has worked in both the US and the UK, focusing on access to and quality of healthcare, especially for people with chronic health conditions. Specific topics of research have included the self-management of chronic respiratory diseases, patterns of healthcare utilization for different population groups, and measuring health system performance using routinely collected data. 

She holds a PhD in Health Services Research from Imperial College London's Institute of Global Health Innovation, as well as an MSc in International Health Policy from LSE, and a BA(Hons) in Political Economy from Tulane University in New Orleans.
